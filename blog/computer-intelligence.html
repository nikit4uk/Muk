                    <p class="blog__date">June 2, 2024</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog__body">
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is gradually penetrating our lives in almost all spheres. A new development is generative artificial intelligence (GenAi), which allows not just the systematization and processing of information but also the creation of content. Let's understand what GenAi is and what Amazon Web Services can offer in this direction now.</p>
                    <p>As the next step in the development of artificial intelligence, generative AI gives the ability to create a variety of content, including images, videos, music, and so much more. It can learn human language, programming language, and various subjects like chemistry or biology. Therefore, GenAi can be used for a variety of purposes, such as product development and design, creating chatbots or multimedia. In particular, one of the most prominent examples of the use of generative artificial intelligence is the globally popular ChatGPT application, which is a chatbot capable of dialogically answering questions related to various subject areas.</p>
                    <h4>Here are just a few examples of how generative<br> artificial intelligence can help companies:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accelerating research;</li>
                        <li>Improving customer service;</li>
                        <li>Optimizing business processes;</li>
                        <li>Increase staff productivity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>GenAi: models and working principles</h4>
                    <p>Generative artificial intelligence works based on machine learning models that have been pre-trained on huge datasets. A distinction is made between basic models (FM) and large language models (LLM).</p>
                    <p>Baseline models are machine learning models trained on a wide range of generalized and unlabeled data and capable of performing a range of general tasks. Typically, they use learned patterns and relationships to predict the next element of a sequence.  For example, when an image is created, the model analyzes it and creates a sharper and clearer version or predicts the next word in a text string based on previous words and their context.</p>
                    <p>Large language models are one class of basic models. Their peculiarity is that they are able to perform multiple tasks due to certain properties that allow complex concepts to be mastered. LLMs can take into account many parameters and create content even with a small amount of input data, learning to apply their knowledge in a wide variety of contexts.</p>
                    <p>While traditional machine learning models have attempted to determine the relationship between known and unknown factors by looking at known data (e.g., images included in the training set) and mapping them to unknown data (words), generative models simplify these processes. They examine the distribution of different characteristics of the data and their relationships. For example, generative models analyze images of animals and capture variables such as various shapes of ears, eyes, tails, and skin. They study the features and their interrelationships to understand what different animals look like as a whole. They can then create new images of animals that were not in the training dataset.</p>
                    <p>Next, let's look at several categories of generative artificial intelligence models.</p>
                    <p>Diffusion models create new data by iteratively making controlled random changes to an initial sample of data. They start with the original data and gradually reduce its similarity to the original by adding minor changes, called noise. This noise is carefully controlled to ensure that the generated data maintains integrity and realism. The diffusion model then reverses the process over several iterations, gradually removing the noise and resulting in a new data sample that resembles the original.</p>
                    <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) also develop the concept of the diffusion model. GANs train two neural networks in an adversarial fashion. The first, called the generator, creates fake data samples by adding random noise to them. The second, called discriminator, tries to distinguish accurate data from the fake data created by the generator. During the learning process, the generator continually improves its ability to create realistic data, and the discriminator gets better and better at distinguishing accurate data from fake data. This process continues until the generator produces such convincing data that the discriminator cannot distinguish it from the correct data. Such models are widely used in realistic image-generation tasks.</p>
                    <p>Variational autoencoders (VAE) are trained on a mathematical representation of data called hidden space. It can be thought of as a unique code that represents the data based on all its attributes. For example, when learning faces, the hidden space contains numbers representing the shape of the eyes, nose, cheekbones, and ears. VAEs utilize two neural networks: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to the mean and variance for each dimension of the hidden space. It generates a random sample from a Gaussian distribution. This sample is a point in the latent space and is a compressed, simplified version of the input data. The decoder takes this sample from the hidden space and transforms it into data resembling the original signal. Mathematical functions are used to measure how well the reconstructed data matches the original data.</p>
                    <p>The Transformer-based generative artificial intelligence model builds on the concept of the VAE encoder and decoder. Transformer-based models add new layers to the encoder to improve performance on textual tasks, including comprehension, translation, and creative writing. Transformer-based models evaluate the importance of different parts of an input sequence in processing each element of that sequence. Also, an important feature of these models is the implementation of context embedding. The coding of a sequence element depends not only on the component itself but also on its context in the sequence.</p>

                        <li>Telecommunications</li>
                        <li>Energy</li>
                    </ul>
